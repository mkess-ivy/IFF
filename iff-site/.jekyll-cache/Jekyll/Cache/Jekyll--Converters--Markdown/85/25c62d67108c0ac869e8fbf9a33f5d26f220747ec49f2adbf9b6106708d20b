			<p>Our vision is that the Black community will embrace a journey of a more prosperous and equitable future.

			<p>Pursuit of a vision is more than knowing, thinking and talking about our issues.  Pursuit is an active involvement with our brothers and sisters that are impacted by economic and social issues that face our Black community.</p>

			If we can not envision and work for a different tomorrow, then our present-day existence will become our fate.</p>

			<p>The mission and vision of the Ingram Family Foundation is not without challenge, but we believe a different day is attainable.</p>

			<p>Our mission is to promote thoughtful analysis, discussions and actions that will change our present-day existence.</p>

			<!-- <p>Are we satisfied with the existence of our Black community or can we envision a different day?  We represent 13% of the American population.  We represent 40% of the prison population and 27% of Americans living in poverty.  The issues are the same in any given area of our lives: education, health care, etc.</p>

			<p>We did not come out of slavery to be imprisoned and impoverished.</p> -->
			<p>We want to impact our communities across education, health care, arts &amp; life planning.  We want to reduce the number of people of color incarcerated in the U.S prison system and decrease the number of homelessness that impacts our communities and families.  We can do this by creating sustainable programs that are managed and operated within our communities.</p>
			<p>The Ghanian word Sankofa translates to "go back and get it".  It is essential that people research their history, learn about their traditions and culture, so that they may blaze a path forward, consciously aware of all things that make them who they are.</p>
