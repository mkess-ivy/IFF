title: The Ingram <br/>Family History
permalink: /family-history/

family_paragraph_1: "The Ingram Family roots are traced back to Icean and Anna Ingram, who lived in Northampton County, North Carolina during the early 1800’s.  Since Icean and Anna, nine generations of offspring have come into this world, and six of those generations still exist."
family_paragraph_2: "From the beginning, God has set people in families to love and care for one another.  Nowhere on earth are there people who do not belong to families.  The Ingram Family is grateful to God for allowing us to exist for countless generations."
family_paragraph_3: "“Deep Roots, Strong Branches, Solid Fruits” is our perspective of life.  We started the Foundation with the belief that every family and community invest in their roots, strengthen the branches and enjoy the fruits."
